Overviews of the Theodo library books I've read so far.

- ## Scrum: The art of doing twice the work half the time
  - ### Author: Jeff Sutherland
  - ### Key Points: 
    - Gives the 'why' behind the SCRUM methodology
    - Highly effective teams are able to be hundreds/thousands of times more productive than individuals.
    - Teams should be cross-disciplined and self-organising.
    - A SCRUM team should consist of a number of developers, a SCRUM master and a product owner.
    - The optimum number of team members is 3-9. Beyond that the amount of communication needed to keep everyone on the same page becomes exponentially larger, and productivity decreases.
    - Teams should meet every morning is 'daily standup' meeting to discuss work done yesterday, and work to be done today. Max meeting length of 15 minutes.
    - Work is not valuable unless it is completely finished and released. Tasks should be framed as 'user stories' which demonstrate the value-adding work done.
    - Work should be carried out in 'sprints'. In each sprint the team takes as many tasks to do as they believe they can commit to. Once committed, no more work can be added or removed. Sprints typically last between 1 week and 1 month, but for a given team the length of sprints is fixed.
    - At the end of every sprint the team should show their finished work to stakeholders, and discuss what went well/badly in the sprint and what can be improved.
    - Working longer hours leads to less productivity. This is especially the case for SCRUM teams, where the productivity falls off rapidly beyond 40 hours per week.
    - Team members should only work on one ticket at a time, due to the high cost of 'context-switching'.
    - Bugs are **extremely** costly to fix if not spotted and fixed straight away (He reckons at least 24X). Therefore testing work as you go in a tight feedback loop is essential.
  - ### Why should you read it?:
    - As SCRUM is a key part of the Theodo methodology/process, it is important to understand all of the parts of it thouroughly. This is especially useful when working with teams of developers from the client's company, as they will likely have a poor knowledge of the process, and may have many questions.
    - Knowing the benefits and the *why* of the process we carry out is very motivating, and can help convince you to stick to the process and not be tempted to take shortcuts.
    - The author of the book was one of the original creators of SCRUM. It is good to learn information straight from the source rather than second or third hand.
  - ### Downsides of the book:
    - The author is quite self-congratulatory at times which can get a bit frustrating. Take these bits with a pinch of salt and power through it!
    - Lots of examples in the book have quite a military vibe.

- ## Getting Naked
  - ### Author: Patrick Lencioni
  - ### Key Points:
    - The book describes a 'naked' style of working with clients based on being open and vulnerable.
    - There are 3 key fears that consulatants face that sabotage client loyalty, and practical methods are given to overcome each of these fears:
      - The fear of losing the business
        - Always consult instead of sell
        - Give away the business
        - Tell the kind truth
        - Enter the danger
      - The fear of being embarrassed
        - Ask dumb questions
        - Make dumb suggestions
        - Celebrate your mistakes
      - The fear of feeling inferior
        - Taking the bullet for the client
        - Make everything about the client
        - Honor the client's work
        - Do the dirty work
    - By consulting in this style, your company can work **shorter hours**, be **more successful**, and **charge higher fees** than other consultancies.
  - ### Why should you read it?:
    - The book is short (240 pages, large font) and well written, and can be read in about 4 hours. It is written as a 'business fable' that follows the story of a consultant as he discovers this 'naked' style of working.
    - The 'naked' style of consulting is very beneficial at Theodo due to our close contact with clients, and our responsibility to challenge clients.
    - For this way of working, simply reading the bullet points above won't do enough to convince you the value of this method. It is essential to know the 'why' behind the steps.
  - ### Downsides of the book:
    - On the whole the book is quite believable, but towards the end of the book it gets a bit melo-dramatic.

- ## The Gold Mine
  - ### Author: Michael Ballé
  - ### Key Points:
    - The book follows the story of a factory going through a lean transformation.
    - The factory starts in a very bad financial position, and a low level of productivity. By working to reduce the amount of stock throughout the factory, the problems and inefficiencies in the factory are exposed, allowing them to be solved.
    - A key analogy in the book, is that running a manufacturing process is like sailing a boat on a lake. Problems in the process are thought of as rocks in the bottom of the lake, and the ammount of stock in the process is the water level. If you decrease the amount of water in the lake, the rocks become visible and can be removed. I.e. if you reduce the amount of stock in your flow, you can find and eliminate your problems.
  - ### Why should you read it?:
    - You will gain a solid understanding of Lean from the process engineering point of view (where it originated).
    - Demystify much of the jargon around Lean, i.e. Single-Piece Flow, Takt Time, Kaisen, Kanban (Pull System), 5S, Continuous Flow, Gemba, Just In Time, Muda, Value Stream Mapping.
    - Understand the challenges of applying lean to companies, in particular the many inter-personal difficulties that will arise.
  - ### Downsides of the book:
    - The book is fairly long (325 pages, small font), taking about 10 hours to read.
    - The writing style can be frustrating at times, especially in the dialogue which often feels un-natural.
    - Lots of the book is based in an indrustrial manufacturing setting, and so is less relevant to software engineering than 'Lead with Respect'.
